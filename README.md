# Refactoring / Introduce Parameter Object

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll be replacing a long list of parameters with a parameter object. The method in question is `#calculate_cost` in `ShippingCalculator` which currently takes up to five parameters. This abstraction pattern leads to cleaner code and helps to naturally group parameters.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/introduce-parameter-object.git
    cd introduce-parameter-object
    bin/setup

Replace the list of parameters in `ShippingCalculator#calculate_cost` with a singular parameter object. The existing test suite will need to be modified to accept one parameter as well, however, no new tests should need to be added as this is the "refactoring" phase of [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

When you're finished, `ShippingCalculator#calculate_cost` should accept just one parameter.

Make sure all tests are passing by running:

    rake
